# GrADS-scripts
Selected scripts for use with the Grid Analysis and Display System (GrADS) program.

This repository includes selected scripts for use with GrADS. While GrADS is no longer being actively developed, it retains its popularity for working with GRIB-formatted data and ensembles.

There is currently one file in this repository:
* interp.gs - a general purpose vertical interpolation script. Suitable for interpolating data to any desired vertical coordinate, though it works best when the desired isosurface only occurs once in the vertical.
